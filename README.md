As part of an operating systems course, developed a scheduler in C on a Linux platform that simulated core OS scheduling and memory management behavior. The project featured the implementation of three distinct algorithms—Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), and Preemptive Highest Priority First (PHPF)—to manage process execution. Processes were manually forked and terminated, allowing full control over their lifecycle. Communication between the scheduler and child processes was handled through inter-process communication techniques such as pipes and shared memory. Additionally, memory management was achieved using the buddy system, enabling dynamic allocation and deallocation of memory blocks in response to process events.
